Project Euler stuff in Rust

My attempts at learning Rust and GitHub.

Structure is as follows:
- main.rs calles the main-functions of the submodules
- By submodules we mean pe_n, which stands for the nth exercise of ProjectEuler
- Folder helper can be usesd as our own little module to hold various functions (!) WIP (!)
